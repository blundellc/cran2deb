To install:

$ cd ..
$ R CMD INSTALL cran2deb

copy cran2deb/exec/cran2deb into somewhere in your executable path (e.g.,
/usr/local/bin, $home/bin)



To configure:

1. You need a web server serving from say, /var/www/cran2deb/

Let ROOT be the value returned by running: cran2deb root

2. ROOT/var/archive should be a symlink pointing to /var/www/cran2deb/
    $ rm ROOT/var/archive
    $ ln -s /var/www/cran2deb/ ROOT/var/archive
3. modify OTHERMIRROR of ROOT/etc/pbuilderrc.in to point to your webserver
4. cran2deb needs a persistent cache outside of R's control. therefore, create
    /var/cache/cran2deb, writable by whichever user(s) will run cran2deb.
5. run: cran2deb update
6. Try building a simple package: cran2deb build zoo
   (The result will be in /var/cache/cran2deb/results)
